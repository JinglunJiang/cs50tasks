Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations increases, the predictions become more accurate and reliable. With a larger number of simulations, the chances of the teams winning converge towards their true probabilities.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

From the given data, it appears that the predictions stabilize and reach a relatively accurate level after around 10,000 simulations. Beyond that point, the improvements in accuracy become less significant compared to the increased compute time.
